To get started, visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/enzo1311/ffbe-spritesheets/releases) to download the latest spritesheets. After downloading, extract the files to your project directory.

1. **Download the spritesheets**: Go to the [Releases section](https://github.com/enzo1311/ffbe-spritesheets/releases) and choose the version you want.
2. **Extract the files**: Unzip the downloaded file.
3. **Add to your project**: Place the spritesheets in your projectâ€™s assets folder.

## Usage

Integrating the spritesheets into your game is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a basic example of how to use the spritesheets with HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

### HTML Setup

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>FFBE Character Sprites</title>
    <style>
        canvas {
            border: 1px solid black;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="gameCanvas" width="800" height="600"></canvas>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

### JavaScript Code

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('gameCanvas');
const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

const spriteSheet = new Image();
spriteSheet.src = 'path/to/spritesheet.png'; // Replace with your spritesheet path

spriteSheet.onload = function() {
    ctx.drawImage(spriteSheet, 0, 0, 64, 64, 100, 100, 64, 64); // Example drawing
};
```

This code sets up a basic HTML5 canvas and draws a character from the spritesheet.

## Spritesheet Overview

Each spritesheet contains multiple frames for character animations. The frames are organized in a grid format, allowing you to easily access each frame by specifying its coordinates.

### Example Structure

- **Character Name**: character_name.png
  - Frame 1: (0, 0)
  - Frame 2: (64, 0)
  - Frame 3: (128, 0)
  
You can use these coordinates to animate your characters by changing the frame displayed on the canvas.
